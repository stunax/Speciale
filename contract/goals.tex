\section{Project goal} % (fold)
\label{sec:project_goal}
The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis preparing for an
advanced deep learning segmentation algorithm in a followup project.
A previously implemented deep learning implementation proved inadequate,
and the purpose of this project is to understand why,
and how we might be able to take full advantage of the power of CNNs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test current annotation with "simple" classifiers for segmentation
    \item Use unsupervised method and compare with supervised
    \item Test the previous using different preprossecing methods
    \item Postprocess results, and compare result
    \item Test 2d versus 3d features measuring both performance and gains when going 3d
    \item Compare with previous results
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning goals}
The learning goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learn to manipulate data in several dimensions where structure is important.
    Both in two and in three image dimensions.
    \item Learn to use unsupervised learning, to produce ground truth annotation for segmentation
    \item Learn the basics of semisupervised learning
    
\end{itemize}
