\section*{Segmenting tubular structures in pancreas using deep learning} % (fold)
\label{sec:title}
There is a hypotheses that during pancreatic differentiation, the structure of
the lumen network, in which the cells are situated, dictates which cells are
turning into beta cells.
Finding these structures so they can be studied is the first step in proving
this hypotheses.
For this analasys, five 3d films of pancreas development have been recorded on
mice, and have been annotated with some labels in preperation for this study.
The data have already been shown to include some errors, so these have to be
fixed or removed before segmentation

\section*{Project objectives} % (fold)
\label{sec:project_goal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore the data, and fix errors in the dataset
    \item Segment the images using CNN with current labels.
    \item Try different preprossesing methods and record the impact
    \item Try different semisupervised learning techniques to include unlabeled
    data in analasys
\end{itemize}
