\section{Text Features}
So, you will notice a few things are awesome in this template.\todoyellow{First of all, the todo notes}
Things are really nice, using a standard scientific margin size (I don't know if this is true but it sounds cool).\todored{remember todonotes comes in multiple colors! with the [color=?] option, or... in the cls file you can
create custom functions for making todo commands like... \texttt{\textbackslash todored}}

If you have an "empty" line inbetween two paragraphs in the code, this will be treated as two separate paragraphs! no
\text{\newline} shit two times...

the references has been ordered nicely by appearance, so even thought this \cite{dewey2010need} comes second in the bib file,
it will come before \cite{Lamport:1989:LDP:63364} in the references, because it is referenced first in the text!

You will notice that in the header, a "warning" is written, well... in the start of main there are a couple of flags you can set.
One of which is if the paper is a draft, if set true, a warning is printet and the todonotes are included, if set to false,
the draft thing dissappears and the todonotes also. (pretty smart, so not you dont have to fix the shit in the todos and delete them, just ignore them!).
The other is if you want a ku front page on your paper, which, you know, doesn't hurt I guess? otherwise just set it to false and it wont appear.
