\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}
There exists a hypothesis that the structure of the lumen network in pancreas, dictates which cells turn into beta cells.
To test this hypothesis, annotated data of the pancreas is required.
To annotate this data by hand would be a huge project, so we explore if it's possible to automate.

Deep learning using neural networks has become one of the main tools for computer vision.
With enough training data it is possible to use convolutional deep learning for almost every traditional computer vision task.

We attempt to segment the 3d videos of the pancreas structure using convolutional networks.
Due to limited amounts of labels, a semisupervised approach is tested to see if the predictions can be improved.
To improve the result, different kinds of preprocessing combinations is tested, to figure out the best combination.
